# my-page

I created this little React app for learning and practice purposes.
This app will also be used as frontend or a "gateway" to some other apps in other technologies that I am studying.

## About these branches:
- main is the stable code
- gh-pages is the branch publiched. It should contain the sabe version as main
- dev is the branch where development and tests are done.

Note:
After commiting and pushing, the command "npm run deploy" must be run to deploy.
If you are on my website url and you are reading this, I probably forgot to run that command!
